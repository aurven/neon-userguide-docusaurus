# 1. Sandbox Purpose

The Neon sandbox is a pre-configured, non-production environment that provides access to Neon in a safe and isolated way. It allows users to try the product without affecting live systems or real customer data.

The sandbox is designed to support exploration, learning, and evaluation. It gives customers and prospects a practical way to experience Neon and understand how its features and workflows work in real scenarios, before moving to a production environment.

## Who the sandbox is for

The sandbox can be used by:

- Editorial users, such as editors, content producers, and audience or SEO specialists, who want to explore how Neon supports content creation, curation, and publishing workflows.
- Product owners and business stakeholders who need to understand how NEON fits into existing processes, governance models, and team responsibilities.
- Customer technical teams (e.g. developers, solution architects, CMS/platform owners) evaluating Neon’s capabilities, integration options, and configuration model.
- Implementation partners and agencies who are involved in discovery, prototyping, or preparing for a future Neon rollout.

Within the sandbox, users can be assigned with different roles based on the setup. This may include standard users or more specific administrator profiles (for example, for sites, users, or content).

## What you can do in the sandbox

Within the sandbox, users can:

- Access an already set up Neon environment that includes example content, modules, and workflows designed to illustrate typical editorial journeys.
- Explore available features and workflows, follow guided demos and user guides, and run through end‑to‑end scenarios such as planning, creating, approving, and publishing content.
- Experiment freely in a risk‑free context: you can create, edit, and delete content, adjust certain settings, and try different ways of working without impacting any live site or production instance.

## Feedback and Collaboration

Your feedback is very welcome. The sandbox is meant to support discussion, learning, and discovery, and we encourage you to share questions, observations, or ideas as you explore Neon.

If something is unclear, or if you’d like to discuss your experience or use cases, feel free to contact your designated Eidosmedia representative. We’re happy to learn together and adjust the sandbox experience where possible.

# 2. Sandbox Access

Access to the Neon sandbox is provided as part of a trial or evaluation period and is managed by the Eidosmedia team.

Once the sandbox is made available, users will receive:

- A sandbox URL
- Login credentials for different types of roles

The sandbox is provided for a flexible evaluation period, based on your needs and the agreed trial scope. This period typically lasts **several weeks to month. During this time, users can access the sandbox environment and explore Neon accordingly.

Access rights and available features may be preconfigured for the duration of the sandbox. These settings are intended to support evaluation and guided exploration.

# 3. Sandbox Features

To get the most out of your NEON sandbox experience, we recommend using the [Neon User Guide](https://neon-userguide.onrender.com/docs/user-guide/) as your main reference. It provides step-by-step instructions for each feature, so you can explore the platform in a structured way and learn how to use each capability effectively.

# 4. Sandbox Data Handling

The Neon sandbox is designed to support evaluation and exploration using temporary data.

Data available in the sandbox may include sample or preconfigured content created specifically for demonstration and trial purposes. Any content, configuration, or changes created by users during the trial should be considered non-persistent.

During the sandbox period:

- Data may be reset if needed to restore a clean state
- Content and configuration are not guaranteed to be retained throughout the trial

When the sandbox trial ends:

- The sandbox environment is decommissioned
- Data and configuration stored in the sandbox are removed

Because the sandbox is intended for non‑production data, it is not the appropriate place to store regulated, confidential, or sensitive information. Users are responsible for ensuring that any data they upload or create in the sandbox complies with their internal policies and applicable regulations.

# 5. Sandbox Troubleshooting

If you have trouble accessing the environment, logging in, or using specific features, please refer to the [Neon User Guide](https://neon-userguide.onrender.com/docs/user-guide/) first. The guide is organized by topic and includes a [Common fixes](https://neon-userguide.onrender.com/docs/user-guide/common-fixes) section covering frequently reported issues and recommended solutions.

If you encounter any other issues, we recommend contacting your designated Eidosmedia representative as the first point of reference.

In some cases, the sandbox environment may be reset or adjusted to resolve issues or to support ongoing evaluation. If this happens, users will be informed and guided accordingly.
