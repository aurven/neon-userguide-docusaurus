## How do I search for stories, media, or webpages in Neon?

Click the search icon at the top of the menu bar. You will then be directed to the search page.

Here, you can find stories, media, or webpages stored in Neon. You can search using text and select the type (image, webpage, story, live blog) from the drop-down menu. You can also choose a time range to show only relevant content.

On the left side, you will see the filter panel, which helps you filter and display items that match specific criteria such as publishing status, edition, workfolder, workflow status, and created by.

Later, when you want to reuse that search, just click the **Saved queries** button, select the query you saved, and Neon will automatically apply the same filters, saving you time from re-entering them manually.

## How can I efficiently search for specific stories or content in Neon?

Finding the right content in Neon can be fast and precise if you make use of its advanced search features. Here are some tips:

- **Use specific filters in the left panel:** Narrow down your search using filters such as *Workfolder*, *Created by*, *Workflow status*, or *Edition* to quickly find exactly what you're looking for.
- **Switch to thumbnail view for images:** If you're searching for media assets, especially images, try switching from list view to *thumbnail view*. This gives you a larger visual preview, making it easier to spot the file you need.
- **Save frequently used filters as a query:** If you often search using the same combination of filters, save that configuration as a *Saved Query*. You can reuse it anytime without resetting filters.
- **Use search history to revisit previous queries:** You can quickly revisit your recent searches using the *History* tab in the search interface. This is helpful when switching between tasks and returning to earlier content.

## Why can't I find the story or file I'm looking for?

If you're having trouble locating a specific story, image, or file in Neon, here are a few things to check:

- Check your filters: You might have active filters (like date range, workflow status, or author) that are hiding the item. Try clearing or adjusting them.
- Double-check the search term: Make sure there are no typos in the title or keyword you're using.
- Check the workfolder or edition: The content might be stored in a different workfolder or edition than the one currently selected.

If you're still not finding what you need, try broadening your search or ask a teammate if the item might be in different folder or under a different title.

## Why is my saved query not returning the same results as before?

There are a few common reasons why your saved query might return different results:

- **Content has been updated or moved:**  Items may have been deleted, published, or moved to a different folder or edition since the last time you ran the query.
- **Filters are based on dynamic values:** If your query includes filters like "Last 7 days" or "Created today," the results will naturally change over time.

To fix this, review your filters, consider switching from dynamic to fixed date ranges, and update or re-save the query based on your current needs.
