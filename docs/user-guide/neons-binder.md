### Document Structure

Document Structure shows the hierarchical layout of your content.

The Attribute Inspector in the Binder shows detailed  technical attributes related to the selected content element (like an article, image, or block).

This panel is mostly useful for advanced users or developers who need to understand or tweak the underlying properties of content components.
