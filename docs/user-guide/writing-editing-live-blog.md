# Writing and Editing Live Blog

## What is a live blog?

A live blog is a type of content you can create in Neon that allows you to provide real-time updates at the top of a story. It is particularly useful for covering ongoing events such as press conferences, breaking news, or live sports. By adding live updates, you can keep your audience continuously informed as the situation unfolds, while keeping all updates organized within a single story.

## How do I create a live blog?

To create a new live blog, click the "Add" button in the top navigation bar or use the Quick Link from your dashboard.

A window will appear where you need to enter the story details, such as the name, edition, workfolder, and type. Make sure to fill in the Name and Workfolder, as they are mandatory fields.

Once the information is complete, you'll be directed to the Live Blog Editor page, where you can begin writing and editing your content.

On the left side is the Story Editor, where you can write your main story. On the right side is the Live Blog section, where you can submit live updates. You can choose to set the update to **Now** to publish it in real time, or select a specific date and time

## How do I add a liveblog update?

In order to submit a live blog update that appears on the live site, you need to make sure the story is published first. To do this, go to the Story Editor on the left side, open the **Binder**, select **Publication**, choose the site where you want to publish, and then click **Publish**. Once the story is published, any live blog updates you submit in the Live Blog section will be published automatically on the site.

## How do I add media to my live blog?

Just like adding an image or media to a story, you can add media stored in Neon or embed external media into a live blog.

For each live blog update, you can also drag media directly from the Candidate Browser in the Binder into the message box of the live blog.

## How do I edit a live blog update?

You can edit an existing liveblog directly from the dashboard by clicking the pen icon on the story card or by clicking the story and selecting the Edit button

Please note that editing is only available to users with the appropriate permissions.

## How can I format live blog entries for better readability?

Your story format often depends on your audience and your company's editorial guidelines. That said, Neon can help you improve readability by providing useful features such as:

- Adding images to each live blog update to provide visual context and make updates more engaging.
- Maintaining a consistent format for each update, including a date, a clear title, and a concise message. You can also use Proactions suggestions to adjust the length of your text as needed.
- Applying text styles and formatting tools (e.g., bold, italic, bullet points) from the live blog update editor to highlight key information.
- You can preview your story regularly to check the layout and readability before publishing.

## Why can't I submit a live blog update?

If you can't submit a live blog update and receive an error message, it usually means that your story has not been published yet. In order to submit live blog updates successfully, the story must be published first. To do this, go to the Story Editor, open the binder, select the publication and site where you want to publish, and click **Publish**. Once the story is published, you will be able to submit live blog updates without issues.

Another possible reason is a **temporary network or server issue**. If your internet connection is unstable or if there's a temporary outage on the Neon server, the update might fail to submit. In that case, try refreshing the page or waiting a few moments before trying again. If the issue persists, contact your system administrator or support team.

## Why is the new site not updated with my latest live blog submission?

Sometimes, updates to your live blog may take a little time to appear on the live site due to caching or server delays. If your latest submission isn't showing up right away, please wait a few minutes and refresh the page.
