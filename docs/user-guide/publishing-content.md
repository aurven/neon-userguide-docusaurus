# Publishing Stories, Live Blog, and Webpages

## How do I publish a story, live blog, or webpage?

First, make sure that your content has reached the required workflow status (such as "Ready"), depending on your organization's publishing flow.

Once your content is ready, open the **Publication** panel from the binder and choose the sites and sections where you want to publish it. From there, click the **Settings** icon to configure your publication options, such as **site importance, visibility,** or **paywall** settings that will only be applied to that specific content.

## How do I set the visibility date?

Click the **Settings** icon in the site where you want to publish the content.

Under the **Manage Dates** section, set the **From** and **To** dates along with the specific time, then click **Apply**.

When you click **Show Preview** and are redirected to the preview site, you'll see a small chip indicating when the content will become visible.

If you select a **future date**, the content will not appear on the live site immediately after publishing, it will only be visible once the scheduled time arrives.

## How do I make sure that the published content is up to date with all the latest changes?

If you or someone else has made changes that haven't been published yet, a chip with an **orange** label will appear in the **Publication** panel, indicating that there are pending unpublished changes. To update the live site, click **Publish** again.

A **green** chip means all recent changes have already been published and are up to date.

## Why isn't my story showing up on the live site after publishing?

If your story isn't appearing on the live site right after publishing, here are a few things you can check:

- Wait a moment since the server may take a few seconds to reflect the update
- Check that the visibility date and time are not set in the future
- Make sure the content has actually been published and not just saved

If the issue persists, try refreshing the live site or preview tab. If it still doesn't appear, contact your technical team or support for further help.
