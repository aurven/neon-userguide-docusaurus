# Common Fixes

## What should I do if Neon is slow or unresponsive?

If Neon is slow or unresponsive, try the following steps to improve performance:

- Clear Neon's cache directly from within Neon (see instructions below)
- Clear your browser cache and cookies
- Close and reopen your browser or try using a different browser to see if the issue persists.
- Check your internet connection to ensure it's stable and fast.
- If the problem continues, try logging out and back into Neon, or restart your device.
- If none of these steps help, contact your IT support or Neon's helpdesk for further assistance.

## How do I clear the cache in Neon?

You can clear the cache by selecting the Clear Cache option from the profile dropdown menu or by using the Cache Manager. Choosing Clear Cache will delete all cache within Neon directly, while selecting Cache Manager will open a new window displaying a list of cached items, allowing you to manage them individually.

Inside the Cache Manager, you can see a list of all cached items stored within Neon. You can select specific caches to clear, allowing you to keep certain caches intact while focusing on resolving the issue you're experiencing.

## What problems can be fixed by clearing the cache?

Clearing the cache can resolve various common issues in Neon, such as slow performance, loading problems, and occasional errors. It essentially forces the system to reload fresh data, helping to fix glitches that occur due to stored outdated information.

## I cleared my cache but the problem persists, what should I do next?

If the problem continues, it's a good idea to contact your support team or system administrator and provide specific details, such as the affected feature, what you expected to see, and what you're experiencing.
