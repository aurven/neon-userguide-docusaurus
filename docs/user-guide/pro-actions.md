# Pro Actions

## What is Pro Actions?

Depending on your organization, you may have access to built-in tools that assist with writing, such as automation options available through **Pro Actions**, a feature in Neon designed to help streamline your content creation process.

Pro Actions allow you to apply pre-configured functions to your content, such as shortening text, translating, summarizing, and more. These tools are especially useful when you want to quickly refine or adapt your content without manually editing every detail. You can apply a single action or chain multiple actions together to support specific editorial workflows.

By integrating Pro Actions into your writing routine, you can boost productivity, maintain consistency, and focus more on storytelling.

✨ You can **enhance your Pro Actions workflow by integrating Neon's advanced AI features**. If you're interested in unlocking these benefits, feel free to contact the Neon team to explore how we can support your editorial goals with the right  tools.

## How do I access Pro Actions?

You can access Pro Actions in three main ways:

## Can I customize or configure Pro Actions to fit my needs?

Pro Actions are usually pre-configured depending on your organization, along with some additional extensions that might be available. While you can't customize them directly, the options you see are tailored to your workspace setup.

If you're interested in exploring additional or customized Pro Actions, we recommend having a discussion within your organization and reaching out to the Neon team to explore what's possible together.

## How do I use Pro Actions effectively in my workflow?

Pro Actions simplifies and enhances your content creation by offering a variety of AI-powered tools that can be seamlessly integrated into your writing process from start to finish. Here are some key features that can be optimized: 

- **Transcribe:** Automatically convert audio content such as interviews or podcasts into text, saving time and effort in transcription.
- **Content Suggestion:** Get creative ideas and alternative phrasing using AI-powered suggestions to improve headlines, summaries, and article content.
- **Content Transformation:** Paraphrase, summarize, or restructure your text dynamically to make your writing clearer, more engaging, and easy to understand.

You can find all these powerful functions conveniently grouped in the Pro Actions panel, making it easy to enhance your content directly within your editing workflow.

## Why is a function not loading or working properly?

If a Pro Action function isn't working as expected, consider the following:

- **Unsupported content or context**: Some actions only work in certain areas or with certain content. Make sure you're using the function in a supported place with valid content selected.
- **OpenAI integration issue**: Certain Pro Actions rely on external services like OpenAI. If there's a problem with the integration, such as API limits or connectivity issues, the action might fail.

If the issue persists, it could be a temporary problem on the platform. Try again later or contact system administrator or contact support.
