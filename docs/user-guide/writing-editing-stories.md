# Writing and Editing Stories

## How do I create a new story?

To create a new story, click the "Add" button in the top navigation bar or use the Quick Link from your dashboard (if added). 

![Create Story Button](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2016.png)

A window will appear where you need to enter the story details, such as the name, description, issue date, folder, and content type. Make sure to fill in the **Name** and **Workfolder**, as they are mandatory fields.

![Story Details Form](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2017.png)

Once the information is complete, you'll be directed to the **Story Editor** page, where you can begin writing and editing your content including adding images, writing a headline, summary, and body text. You can also take advantage of **Neon's premium features**, such as the **Pro Actions** quick menu and **AI Companion**, which can be tailored and enabled for your newsroom upon request to help streamline your workflow.

Please note that editing is only available for users who have the appropriate permissions.

## How do I add images or other media to my story?

You can add an image that is already uploaded to Neon by opening the Candidate Browser from the binder on the right side of the Story Editor. Then, simply drag the image you want directly into the story.

Otherwise, if you want to directly add an image from your computer or an external source, you can add content directly from the Story Editor using the toolbar at the top by following these steps: 

### 1. Adding Images

![Insert Image Menu](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2023.png)

- Click Insert from the editor toolbar, then select the Image or gallery option depending on your needs
- An image placeholder will appear in your story.

- Then, you can either:
    - Click the upload icon to select a file from your computer.
    - Drag and drop an image into the placeholder area, or
    - Paste a URL to import an image from an external source.

### 2. Adding Other Media (e.g., videos, or other embedded medias)

![Insert Embed Menu](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2026.png)

- From the Insert menu in the toolbar, select the Embed icon.
- A placeholder will be added to your story.
- Paste the link or embed URL of the media you want to include (e.g., a YouTube video or external audio clip).

Once added, you can fill in the caption, credit, and source fields for context and attribution, position your media within the story, click on the media block, and use the up or down arrows to move it to the desired location in the content.

## How do I edit or crop an image to fit my story layout?

To edit or crop an image in your story, you can follow these steps:

- Click **pen icon** or **edit button** on the image you want to edit or crop
    
    ![Edit Image Button](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2027.png)
    
- Choose the desired aspect ratio
    
    ![Aspect Ratio Options](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2028.png)
    
    You can also add a custom aspect ratio based on your needs by clicking the **+** icon and entering your custom crop name along with the desired width and height.
    
    ![Custom Aspect Ratio](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2029.png)
    
- Adjust the image by dragging it so that the important area fits within the frame.
    - Make sure there are no red borders, as these indicate that parts of the frame are not fully covered by the image.
- You can also use the **Auto Zoom** feature to automatically adjust the image to fit the selected ratio, or enable the **Show Focal Point** option to highlight the most important area of the image during cropping.

- When you're done, click **Save**.

## How do I link another article to my story?

You can add a link to another story by opening the Candidate Browser from the binder on the right side of the Story Editor. Then, simply drag the story you want to add into your current story. This helps you link related articles, providing additional context and guiding your readers to explore more relevant content.

## Where do I find formatting and editing tools in the Story Editor?

First, all formatting and editing tools can be found in the toolbar at the top of the Story Editor. The toolbar is divided into several main sections:

![Story Editor Toolbar](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2032.png)

- **Home**
    
    This section contains essential text styling and paragraph formatting options such as bold, italic, underline, alignment, and list creation. These tools help you quickly format your story content to make it clear and visually appealing.
    
- **Insert**
    
    In the Insert section, you can add various types of media to your story, including images, galleries, and embedded content such as videos or audio clips. You can also add annotations to provide comments or notes linked to specific parts of the story. 
    
- **Document**
    
    In this section, you can pin the story you are working on, so it appears in the **Pinned** section of your dashboard for quick access. You can also copy the story to a different channel or folder.
    
- **View**
    
    The View menu lets you customize how you see your story while editing. You can choose different view options such as showing or hiding annotations, content item IDs, and tags to help you understand the structure.
    
- **Debug**
    
    Typically intended for advanced users or developers, the Debug section provides diagnostic tools to troubleshoot issues. It allows you to view logs, error messages, and other technical details that may be useful when resolving problems within the editor.

Besides clicking options on the toolbar, you can also quickly apply styles or functions using the tooltip that appears when you select text. This provides a faster way to format your content without needing to navigate the full toolbar.

## How can I preview how my story will look when published?

To preview your story, open the Object Panel from the Binder. After selecting a publication site, click the Show Preview icon. 

![Preview Story](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2034.png)

A new page will open, showing how your story will appear once published. At the top, you'll see a bar indicating the visibility time if a specific date and time have been set. This bar also allows you to navigate to the live site, view different versions, and access the story's properties.

## How can I structure or format my story for better readability?

To improve the readability of your story, here are some tips that you can follow:

- Use headings and subheadings to organize your content and guide the reader through different sections.
- Break text into short paragraphs to make it easier to scan and digest.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists to present information clearly and efficiently.
- Highlight important points with bold or italic formatting, but use them selectively to avoid visual clutter.
- Add relevant images or embeds to make the story more engaging and support your content visually.
- Avoid overly complex sentences and aim for clear, direct language.
- Use white space to give your layout a clean and breathable look.

You can always fix formatting using the top menu bar or improve sentences using the automation features available in Pro Actions (see the Pro Actions section to learn more). Furthermore, you can preview your story regularly to check the layout and readability before publishing.

## How can I use Neon's features to speed up the writing and editing process?

Neon offers built-in tools like **Pro Actions** and the **AI Companion** to help streamline your writing and editing workflow. These features let you automate tasks like translating content, shortening text, suggesting headlines, and performing quick web searches. You can also use the AI Companion to brainstorm ideas and write directly within the editor.

Some of these capabilities are part of **AI Premium Features,** advanced tools that may not be available to all users yet but will be available for purchase in the future.

If you don't have access to these features yet but want to learn more, see the Pro Actions and AI Companion sections. You can also contact the Neon team to explore upcoming AI Premium Features or request access.

## Why can't I edit a story?

If you're unable to edit a story, here are a few things to check:

- **Currently being edited by another user**: The story is currently open in a private editing session by another user. To ensure content consistency and prevent conflicts, only one person can edit a story at a time. This dedicated session helps protect your changes and ensures a smooth, uninterrupted editing experience.
- **Permission restrictions**: Your role may not grant you editing access to this story. Please check your permissions or contact your administrator if you believe you should have editing rights.

## What should I do if I accidentally close my story without saving?

Neon automatically saves your work **locally** every 15 seconds while you're editing, helping reduce the risk of losing progress during your session. To ensure your content is permanently saved and accessible across devices or sessions, click the **diskette icon** in the top-left corner or press **CTRL+S** to store it in the database.

![Save Story](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2036.png)

If you need to revisit or recover previous versions of your story, you can access the **Version List** from the **Binder** on the right panel of the Story Editor. This lets you view and restore past saved versions, helping you stay in control even when something unexpected happens.
