# Creating and Editing Web Pages

## How do I create a new web page?

To create a new webpage, click the "Add" button in the top navigation bar or use the Quick Link from your dashboard (if any).

A window will appear where you need to enter the webpage details, such as the name, channel, edition, workfolder, and types. Make sure to fill in the Name, Channel, Workfolder, as they are mandatory fields.

Once the information is complete, you'll be directed to the webpage, where you can construct your page by including the story, gallery, or other content as needed

## How do I add stories to a web page?

To add stories to a web page, open the Candidate Browser from the binder. There, you’ll find a list of stories or live blogs that can be added to your page. You can also use the dropdown menu to filter and locate stories more easily.

Several filters are available to help you find the right content, such as options to view the most recent, ready-to-publish, or related stories within the same workspace or folder. These filters make it faster and easier to find relevant stories based on your needs.

You can also use the **Hide Linked** feature to exclude stories that are already linked within the webpage. This helps you quickly identify existing content and avoid adding duplicates.

There are also additional filters you can use to find relevant stories, such as **Paywall** and **Importance Range**.

After you find the story you want to add, simply drag it to the section of the webpage where you want it to appear, dropping it into the **Drop items here** area.

Furthermore, you can use the **Live Query** feature to automatically fill your webpage with stories. You can learn more about this in the next section.

## How do I arrange and remove stories in a webpage?

You can rearrange stories by simply dragging them within the same zone or moving them to a different zone on the webpage. You can also arrange them by clicking the arrangement icon at the top right of the story card, then choosing where you want to place the story, such as moving it to the top, bottom, or another zone.

To remove a story from the webpage, click the unlink icon, drag the story outside the zone area, and confirm to unlink the story.

## How can I preview how my webpage will look when published?

A live preview is always available on the left panel, allowing you to get immediate visual feedback every time you add, remove, or rearrange content on your webpage.

If you want to see a larger view, you can also open the preview in a new tab by clicking the **Open in new tab** icon. This will open a full-screen version of your webpage, showing exactly how it will appear once published.

You can also access the live preview through the Publication Panel from the Binder. Go to the site where you want to publish, and click the "Show Preview" button.

## How can I maintain a consistent yet engaging and structured approach across multiple webpages or sections?

Keeping your webpages consistent and structured helps build reader trust and makes content easier to manage. Here are a few tips:

- **Follow a clear, repeatable structure**: For example, place premium or featured stories at the top of the page, followed by standard or free-access content toward the bottom.
- **Maintain visual and editorial rhythm**: Keep a balanced mix of headlines, story types, and content length so readers know what to expect without losing interest.
- **Use pinned content strategically**: Pin important or evergreen stories to ensure they always appear in prominent spots, maintaining key messaging and improving reader engagement.

You can easily arrange content inside a WebPage using Neon's intuitive visual indicators, which show whether a story is premium or free, and highlight which articles have the highest priority through icons displayed on each card. You can hover over each icon to see what it means. You can also view the visibility date of each story, giving you greater control over what readers see and when.

## Can I automatically fill a WebPage instead of adding stories manually?

Yes, it's possible to automatically populate a WebPage in Neon. This helps you keep your content up to date based on criteria like section, publication date, priority, and more. To learn how to set this up, please refer to the **Live Query** section.

## Why doesn't the side preview panel work or load properly?

There are a few common reasons why the side preview panel might not load correctly:

- Internet connection issues – A slow or unstable network can prevent the preview from displaying.
- Heavy content or layout complexity – Pages with too many items or intricate designs may delay the preview.

To resolve this, try using the refresh button in the preview panel to reload the content.

If the issue persists, open the preview in a new tab or contact your system administrator

## Why do I see a pending change icon?

![Pending Changes Icon](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2090.png)

This means that there are changes made to the story by you or another user that have not been published yet. To ensure the webpage reflects the most up-to-date version, open the story, review the changes if needed, and publish it. Once published, the latest version will appear on the live webpage.
