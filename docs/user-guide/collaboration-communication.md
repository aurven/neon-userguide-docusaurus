# Collaboration and Communication

## How do I track changes in the workflow of a story or webpage that I created?

From the dashboard, click on any story you want to check, then select **Workflow**. In this window, you can view the current status of your story. You can also click **Diagram Flow** to see a visual overview of the entire workflow and track how far along your story is in the process

This can also be done from the search. Click on any story you want to check, then in the preview panel, you can see the workflow status of the story you're currently in charge of or watching.

## How can I review changes made by others?

To review changes, open your Story, Liveblog, or WebPage, then click the **Binder** icon and go to the **Versions** section. There, you can see a full history of edits made, both by you and by anyone else who has worked on the content.

In the **Annotations** section of the Binder, you'll find comments or notes left by other contributors. This allows you to keep track of feedback, suggestions, or important context shared during the editing process, helping you stay aligned with your team.

## How can I add notes or comments to a story?

Select the portion of text you want to annotate. From the top menu bar, go to **Insert** and choose **Annotation**. You can then add your comment or note directly to that section.

Then anyone accessing that story can also view all annotations in the **Binder**, under the **Annotations** section.
