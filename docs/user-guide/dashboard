### What's the best way to arrange my dashboard for easy access?

The best way to arrange your dashboard depends on your daily tasks and team responsibilities. Dashboards can be edited and customized at any time, allowing you to adapt the layout as your workflow or team priorities evolve. Here are some tips to help you organize it effectively:

- **Decide how to organize your dashboards**
You can either create multiple dashboards based on different functions such as publishing, planning, or monitoring to focus on relevant tasks, or set up a single comprehensive dashboard that combines various widgets like Content List, Query List, and Quick Links to access all your commonly used tools in one place.
- **Quick Links**
Add Quick Links widgets to highlight key queries, pages, or actions you need to access frequently. Whether you're a writer or a webpage editor, you can open what you need with a single, visible click.

- **Start with templates**
To be more efficient, if you or your team already have a dashboard layout that works well for a specific task or role, you can duplicate it and customize it to suit your needs, rather than building one from scratch

- **Pinboard**
You can pin a story, live blog, or webpage that you're currently working on, or that you open frequently, and add it to your dashboard. To show pinned items on your dashboard, add a **Content List** widget to your dashboard and choose **Pinboard** under the preset options. This allows you to quickly navigate to important content and streamline your editing workflow.

### What should I do if some information is not updated or loaded on my dashboard?

If some information on your dashboard is not updated or loaded correctly, try these common fixes:

- Refresh the widget to reload the data.

- Try clearing the cache in Neon (see Common Fixes section).
- Or log out and log back into Neon to reset your session.

If the problem persists, contact your system administrator for further assistance.

## Uploading Files

### How do I upload images or files to Neon?

To upload media, go to the Upload section from the top-right menu. 

![Upload Menu](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2014.png)

Choose the appropriate workfolder and section where the media should be stored, and each section shows the types of files it supports. You can upload by clicking **Select File** or dragging files into the upload area.

![Upload Interface](/img/userguide-screenshots/image%2015.png)

Not only can you upload through the upload menu, but you can always upload images or files directly while creating a story by attaching the relevant media to the content as you work.

### How can I make sure my files are easy to find and manage after upload?

To keep your files organized and easy to retrieve when needed, follow these best practices:

- **Rename files before uploading**
    
    Use a consistent naming convention if your organization provides one. This helps maintain uniformity and prevents confusion across teams.
    
- **Include descriptive names with relevant keywords**
    
    Choose file names that reflect the content or purpose of the image or file. This makes it easier to search for relevant media later when creating or editing content based on the context.
    
- **Upload to the correct section**
    
    Ensure the file is uploaded to the appropriate content area within Neon (such as Newsroom, Sports, or Web Assets). This improves discoverability and keeps media properly categorized.

### Why am I unable to upload my files?

Here are a few possible reasons and how you can resolve them:

- **Unstable internet connection**
    
    A slow or interrupted internet connection can cause the upload process to freeze. Try refreshing your connection or switching to a more stable network.
    
- **Unsupported file type**
    
    Make sure the file format is supported in the selected upload section. 
    
- **Cache or browser-related issues**
    
    Temporary data or settings might interfere with uploads. Try clearing Neon's cache (see Common Fixes section) or your browser cache. You can also try switching to a different browser to see if the issue persists. If the problem persists, contact your system administrator for further assistance.
