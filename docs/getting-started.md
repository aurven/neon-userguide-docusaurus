### 1. Setting Up Profile
Access your profile settings by clicking your user avatar at the top right. From there, navigate to **Profile** to update your name, email, team, and profile picture. This helps personalize your account and makes you easily recognizable to other team members.

### 2. Navigating Dashboard
Your dashboard is the first screen you see after logging in. It gives you an overview of your most recent content, quick links to create new items, saved queries, and any pinned elements for easy access. Clicking the **Dashboard** button in the top-left corner will always return you to this main dashboard view.

### 3. Admin Setting
For Admin, you will have access to settings that allow you to configure user roles and permissions. This means you can assign specific roles to team members based on their responsibilities, control what actions they can perform in the system, and ensure that access to features and content is aligned with their tasks.

### 4. Uploading Files
This section allows you to upload media files such as images and documents, or import them via URL. Uploaded files are stored and can be easily added while creating stories, live blogs, or web pages.

### 5. Searching Content and Media
This section lets you search all content and media stored in Neon, including stories, live blogs, web pages, and uploaded files. It helps you quickly find recent or older items created by you or your team, making it easier to navigate and manage your work.

### 6. Creating Content
To start a new story, live blog, or webpage, click the **Create** icon button located in the main navigation. A dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to select the type of content you want to create. From there, you'll be guided into the appropriate editor where you can begin drafting and organizing your content based on your editorial needs.

### 7. Recently Accessed Content
Under this menu, you can access the content you recently opened, allowing you to quickly return to your latest work without having to search for it again.

### 8. Logging Out
To log out of Neon, click your user avatar in the top-right corner of the screen. The Log Out button will appear. Click it to securely end your session and return to the login screen.
