# Neon User Guide

## What is Neon?

Neon is Eidosmedia's comprehensive digital solution designed to help digital-only and digital-first newsrooms deliver value efficiently and effectively. Its headless and platform-agnostic architecture allows teams to manage multiple sites and create new content types with ease and flexibility through an intuitive UI, without relying on technicians or IT administrators.

The editorial team can write stories, manage live blog updates, schedule publishing, optimize content, and update entire web pages as needed. Neon provides access to the tools relevant to each role, keeping workspaces clean and focused so team members can concentrate on their tasks without distractions.

Neon also empowers editorial teams with AI tools that help refine writing, generate headlines and keywords, improve SEO, and accelerate repetitive editing tasks. Whether publishing breaking news or scheduling content for later, Neon supports the team through every step of the editorial process.

## User Role Guides

Access to features and actions in the system may vary depending on your role, which is defined by your organization. Whether you're a chief editor, author, or contributor, you'll have different levels of access, for example, the ability to edit and publish stories or webpages, or use more advanced features such as semantic search.

All permissions in Neon are assigned based on your role, responsibilities, and editorial needs. If you need access to specific content, features, or capabilities that are currently restricted, please contact your organization's administrator to request a role update or additional permissions.

For more details about role-based access, please refer to our technical documentation.
